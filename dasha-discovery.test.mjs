 * What machines see. Nothing was checking any of it.
 *
 * Every other gate in this repo asks whether a person can use the site. This one asks whether a
 * crawler, a link unfurler or an AI search index can understand it — and on 2026-08-08 the answers
 * were: sitemap.xml is a 404, robots.txt is 200 with an empty body, no route carries structured
 * data, and the live OG card was a stale upload still showing copy that had been removed from the
 * pages themselves. All four are invisible from inside a browser, which is why they survived four
 * audits.
 *
 * The OG card check matters most and is the least obvious. The card is not part of any page; it is a
 * separate binary uploaded to a CDN. It can rot independently of every source file in this repo, and
 * the only place anyone would notice is someone else's timeline.
